#Justification Of Failure

I feel like I should somehow justify the fact that my project
doesn't even meet the intended expectations given in CourseWare.

There is a couple of *reasons* with a common denominator:
    
- I got *bored of coding* for a few early weeks on this project.
  this was mostly caused by the fact I had little idea how to handle
  events, and I just didn't know how to implement any of the stuff.
- I figured out I seriously can't pull work worth a couple of manweeks
  in a weekend. Nope, not happening. Not even with a boatload of coffee.
- My code is quite a bodge. All of it. Navigating between bodges and
  replacing bodges with actual solutions can be fairly time consuming,
  not helping in the point mentioned above.

Can you spot the pattern? **I'm just one heck of a lazy bastard**, it seems.
However, it has sparked some more interest in me in the last few days,
I have to say. Maybe it's the 'deadline press' that wasn't exactly tangible
earlier? I think so.

However, what I have finished now is something that could be somewhat easily
extensible, given a few more weeks of not slacking around and actually working
on it. And I have actually learned a couple of things on the way, which is
really the only point for me. To learn stuff I want to learn about. Surely,
this project isn't really as a cup of tea of mine as my last bloatASM one,
which is an 'universal assembler' thing I wrote for my last semester's stuff,
but eh. I guess I tried.

You are the one to judge me. Judge well.

Thank you.
