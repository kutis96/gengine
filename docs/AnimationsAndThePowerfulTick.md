# Animations and other periodic things
Animation, much as the rendering, is done at multiple levels in Gengine.

## Tick
There's this one special method, **`tick(dt)`**, you'd see quite often throughout
the Gengine. It is meant to be used for all periodic or time-dependent actions
going on within the `World`. All `Tiles` and `WorldEntities` have it too.

The `Tick` is generated by the `Simulator`, typically within a `WorldController`.
The `Simulator` is a `Worker` looping at a fixed time period. Once the time period passes,
the `Simulator` then invokes the `tick` at its `World` it looks over.

The `Tick` is then dispatched to all `WorldEntities` and `Tiles` within that `World`,
so they can take some action on that.

## AnimatedImage
**`AnimatedImage`** is a container containing a set of **`AnimFrames`**,
which only contain an actual `Image`, and a time period in milliseconds.

The job of an `AnimatedImage` is to check whether there has been enough time
passed to move onto the next image, and if so, it does just that.

One can then just `getCurrentImage` off of it, and be done with it.
Quite simple, isn't it.
