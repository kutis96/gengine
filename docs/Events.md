# Event generation and handling.
Event generation is done a bit oddly in Gengine.

The events are actually generated by **`EventGenerators`**
ran by a `WorldController`. Each of those `EventGenerators` extends a `Worker`
class, and it's run in its own `Thread`.

## EventGenerators
These `EventGenerators` then either look around the world or receive events from
elsewhere (typically the `View`'s JPanel events), and then they dispatch
the events by calling every **`EventReceivers`** in the given `World`.

## EventReceivers
The `EventReceivers` are to be only implemented by `WorldEntities` in the given
world and nothing else.

The suggested way of handling those events by something external, such as
another controller, is by creating a hidden (unrendered, invisible) `WorldEntity`
somewhere in the `World`, which would be added there by the given `Controller`
or something. And any actions would be then dispatched by calling various
callbacks in the fake (anonymous) `WorldEntity` to something in the `Controller`.
