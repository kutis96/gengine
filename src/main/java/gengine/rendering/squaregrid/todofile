Tired.

    It turns out I've absolutely fudged up the whole rendering stuff.
I still may want to draw some stuff on some other levels, not just the ground
level, such as random overlays and whatnot. And of course, I wrote it so
the entities get drawn on the top. Always. No matter what. Oh well.
Time to rewrite that.
    I've also finally managed to make this super silly and potentially buggy
ExtendedKeyValLoader. It can load Key:Val pairs, but with an array of values!
Typically comma-separated. Which is actually fairly nice, I guess.
    I may just modify that one for a new TiledWorld loader, but that stuff
sorta works now, so yeah. Fudge it.
    And I've also finished the TileSet loader. It can load animated tiles
as well. In fact, it only loads those. ImageTiles are emulated using
AnimatedTiles with just a single frame.

    Anyway. I REALLY want to fix the renderer, unless I want to call this
problem a feature. Also, that means checking for tiles possibly obstructing
the view, and gah. Kill me.
    Also, I haven't fixed the VisibilityEventGenerator yet. At all.

    Man, I'm tired. Coffee doesn't seem to help, yet it's not all that late
so far.
    Another thing I sort of plan to make is this sentry turret thing as a test,
once I get the VEG done. It could be just sweeping around, and once it sees
something in the vicinity, it'd turn and shoot projectiles at it. So that'd
be a nice excercise, I guess.

    Ah well. I've also got my friend L. Zounek to draw me some tilesets
and a test map and stuff. Which I do super appreciate.
