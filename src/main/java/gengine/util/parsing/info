Actually just a comment on a whole bunch of stuff.

This package isn't used by anything at all so far.
It was originally intended to aid some more sophisticated
    file loading and so on, but I've decided I'm somewhat running out of time,
    so I just left it there for anyone else to pick up.

--- more talky stuff beyond this line ---

I've actually forked this from my previous project where I used this for random
    tokenization for this one Forth-like language interpreter.

I have also originally intended to add some scripting engine to this game engine
    as well, to somewhat surpass the original requirements and make it possible
    to write games without coding any Java in there. Sure, one could just as
    well create a whole sh*tload of generic rogue classes and stuff like that,
    but that just doesn't seem as elegant. OR USE A FACTORY FOR THAT, YAY.

I could have used my F-Like scripting engine already and modified it for
    the use of this, but the thing is, nobody knows any Forth these days
    and seeing any RPN makes most go 'what the f... is this sh..?!' it seems.
    Besides, doing any objecty stuff in F-Like would be rather nuts.

Another possibility would also be adding in some random JavaScript engine;
    there's one already built into most JRE installations. It seems to be rather
    nice, actually. But what's the fun in just using that, eh?
