TODO:
- Add various event handlers
- Add entity controller to handle various events that only
   happen just inside the world - ie. 'AI' for various mostly passive entities,
   etc.


Events that I thought would be somewhat nice to have:
- onMouseClick(mpos)
- onMouseHover(mpos)
- onMouseDrag(mpos-offset, mpos-newpos)
- onMouseLeave()
- onUse(perpetrator,itemstack)
- onHit(perpetrator,itemstack)
- onCollide(perpetrator)
extended for NPCentity:
- onTradeRequest(perpetrator)
- onWorldChange(tileschanged[]) --possibly silly, could be useful for follower bots, so they know some doors have opened/closed without needing to update their paths 24/7

^those should be actually in their own event receivers the WorldEntities should implement themselves

REAL TODO:
 - add some common fields, such as health and stuff. More of those for the player and NPCs and rogues, of course.
 - maybe also add some random 'message boxes' for some entities, so that they could generate events too, which would be collected
   and distributed by something else

When your deadline comes

    It's a strange feeling when the deadline approaches you and demands your
full attention. At this stage, I'm feeling quite... desperate. There's MONTHS
of work to do, and only one day left. I'm contemplating pulling an all-nighter
on this one, commiting a true, 24+ hour codestreak. Should be doable, given
enough caffeine, I think.
    I've also ended up talking to one of my friends again. He's now working on
a tileset for the demo I sorta need to make. Oh well. We'll see how that turns
out.
    Now. Why am I writing this in here?
    Oh. Entity/event stuff.
Actually, this part is mostly done. I've finally figured out how to handle the
stuff, which was holding me back for several weeks before. I'd quite use some
of those weeks now.
    Anyway. I seriously need to finish the VisibilityEventGenerator and stuff
like that. I'll add some other devnote elsewhere.
