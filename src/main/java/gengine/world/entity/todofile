TODO:
- Add various event handlers
- Add entity controller to handle various events that only
   happen just inside the world - ie. 'AI' for various mostly passive entities,
   etc.


Events that I thought would be somewhat nice to have:
- onMouseClick(mpos)
- onMouseHover(mpos)
- onMouseDrag(mpos-offset, mpos-newpos)
- onMouseLeave()
- onUse(perpetrator,itemstack)
- onHit(perpetrator,itemstack)
- onCollide(perpetrator)
extended for NPCentity:
- onTradeRequest(perpetrator)
- onWorldChange(tileschanged[]) --possibly silly, could be useful for follower bots, so they know some doors have opened/closed without needing to update their paths 24/7

^those should be actually in their own event receivers the WorldEntities should implement themselves

REAL TODO:
 - add some common fields, such as health and stuff. More of those for the player and NPCs and rogues, of course.
 - maybe also add some random 'message boxes' for some entities, so that they could generate events too, which would be collected
   and distributed by something else
